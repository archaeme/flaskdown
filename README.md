Installation Instructions
==========================

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR
$ pip install flask Markdown
```

To run the app, simply execute `python3 flaskdown.py` and place some Markdown
files in the same folder.  They will be accessible via 
https://localhost:5000/content/mdfilename (where "mdfilename" is the markdown
file name without the ".md")
